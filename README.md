A signal processing library in Rust, with the goal of being a decent alternative to Matlab's Signal Processing Toolbox and scipy.signal.

At the moment this covers most of Octave's signal package and spcipy.signal's features. Lots of stuff in Matlab's Signal Processing Toolbox that still needs reverse engineering though.

I need to start actually writing the documentation on this thing. Hold on. I have exams first...
